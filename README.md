We will be using the [create-react-app](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app) from the guys over at Facebook

1. First check to see if you have NPM installed

`npm --version`

If not then simply install it by running

`sudo apt install nodejs npm`

2. Let's install create-react-app | -g for global

`npm install create-react-app -g`

Verify it's installed

`create-react-app --version`

3. Now we can finally create a React app!

Start by going into your Desktop directory
`cd Desktop`

then type `create-react app [app name]`. Note that the braces [] are not included.
