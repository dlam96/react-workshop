To make coding in React easier I highly recommend installing these packages in VSCode

1. Simple React Snippets by Burke Holland

2. Prettier - Code formatter by Esben Petersen

# Setup:

We will be using the [create-react-app](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app) from the guys over at Facebook

1. First check to see if you have NPM installed

`npm --version`

If not then simply install it by running

`sudo apt install nodejs npm`

2. Let's install create-react-app | -g for global

`npm install create-react-app -g`

Verify it's installed

`create-react-app --version`

3. Now we can finally create a React app!

Start by going into your Desktop directory
`cd Desktop`

then type `create-react app [app name]`. Note that the braces [ ] are not included.

4. Now that we've created the app folder simply cd to it and start

`cd app name`

`npm start`
 
 While we're at it let's open up the directory in our text editor (I recommend VSCode)
 
 `code .`
